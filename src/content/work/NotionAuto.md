### Inspiration
The main inspiration for this project is to efficiently and reduce the time spent on reading emails and organzing job applications. I was applying to a lot of jobs and it was super time consuming to keep track of all the applications. This is where the idea of Notion Auto came from.

### What it does
Notion Auto is a tool that automatically organizes job applications and updates the status of the application for you. How this work is it reads the emails from your Gmail and determine whether the following content is about a job application. If it is, it updates the status of the application in your Notion database. It also sends you a Slack notification when the status of the application is updated.

### What next for Notion Auto?
