### Inspiration

With recent advancements in generative AI, computers have a better understanding of natural language and generate meaningful data from it than ever before. We were inspired by the potential to improve our shopping experience - specifically in the process of reading reviews. We all read a handful of them to make educated shopping decisions, but it is a process that takes long enough to be annoying. With Review Generator 9000, you can now effectively read tens of reviews without wasting your time.

### What it does

Review Generator 9000 scrapes top positive and critical reviews from the product page the user is currently viewing and feeds the reviews to GPT-3.5 along with an engineered prompt. GPT-3.5 then outputs a JSON, which we visualize right on top of the review page.

#### Technologies used

- Node.js, Express (Backend to process reviews)
- Webpack (Transpiler)
- Manifest V3 (Extension)
- TypeScript (Full-Stack)
- React & TailwindCSS (Injected Content)
- Puppeteer (Web Scraping & Automation)
- GPT3.5 (Generative AI for Data Processing)
- Next.js (Landing/Product Page)

### What's next for Review Generator 9000
- Support for other e-commerce platforms, such as Walmart, Target and Best Buy
- Faster and More Efficient responses
- Using AI to scrape reviews from any website instead of “manual” scraping.
- Determine if reviews were AI-generated and give an “overall legitimacy score”
- Provide references to the summary to validate the summary
- Allow user feedback on our product
