The app then categorizes the transactions and provides a detailed breakdown of the user’s spending habits. This allows the user to make more educated decisions about future budgeting.

### Inspiration
Our main motivation for undertaking this project is from a common issue we’ve experienced in the business world: users usually cannot access in-depth information about a transaction on their banking apps. By enabling customers to upload and link physics receipts, we aim to promote financial responsibility and intelligent budgeting.

### What it does
HandyDollar provides users with a dashboard that organizes their recent transactions sourced through the Plaid API and gives a breakdown of important financial details such as average spending. The main functionality of HandyDollar is the ability to upload and link receipts to their corresponding transactions and using Computer Vision and GPT3.5, provide a breakdown of the receipt that can be viewed on the dashboard.
